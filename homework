From the lesson 2, I have learned that I have to use a resistor with an LED, 
because it may be destroyed immediately.  And also resistors have different type which can limit the flow of electricity. 
Then, through the image, how can I tell which side is postive or which side is negative?

Also about the Breadboard, how the electricity flows in the Breadboard?
As we used Servo Motor 1, is there any power constraints for it?

Once my servo maybehave erratically, 
maybe plugged into different ports. Then, I can have GND or V5 to adding on the breadboard.
What 's GND?
